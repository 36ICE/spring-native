== How to Contribute

This section describes how to extend Spring Native. You can then https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-native/pulls[submit pull requests] in order to add support for a specific part of Spring ecosystem.

=== Contributing new hints

The typical approach is:

. Notice an error if your application when you try to build it or run it -- a `classnotfound`, `methodnotfound`, or similar error.
If you are using a piece of Spring we don't have a sample for, this is likely to happen.

. Try to determine which configuration classes give rise to the need for that reflective access to occur.
Usually, we do a few searches for references to the type that is missing, and those searches guide us to the configuration.

. If there is already a `@NativeConfiguration` implementation for that configuration, augment it with the extra type info.
If there is not, create one, attach a `@NativeHint` to it to identify the triggering configuration and the classes that need to be exposed, and add it to the `META-INF/services/org.springframework.nativex.extension.NativeConfiguration` .
You may also need to set the accessibility in the annotation (in the `@TypeInfo`).
It is possible that more dependencies may need to be added to the configuration project to allow the direct class references.
That is OK, so long as you ensure that they are provided scope.

See <<native-configuration>> for basic hint documentation. These `@NativeHint` can be hosted in one of two places:

* In the `spring-native-configuration` module, you can see that they are hosted on types that implement the
`org.springframework.nativex.extension.NativeConfiguration` interface. Implementations of this interface
should be listed in a `src/main/resources/META-INF/services/org.springframework.nativex.type.NativeConfiguration` file,
which the feature loads through regular Java service loading.
* On Spring configuration classes. That's useful for project-specific hints or while crafting hints on a sample
before moving it to the `spring-native-configuration` module (shorter feedback loop).

An `attribute` trigger can be specified on the `@NativeHint` annotation.

* If the hint is on a `@NativeConfiguration` class, then it is assumed this configuration should *always* apply. This is useful for common configuration necessary for all applications.
* If the hint is on something other than a `@NativeConfiguration` class (e.g. on a Spring auto-configuration class) then that type is considered to be the trigger, and if the Spring AOT plugin determines that is 'active', the hint applies.

The `trigger` attribute might be a piece of Spring infrastructure (autoconfiguration, import selector) or just a regular
class. If the Spring AOT plugin determines that Spring infrastructure may be active when the application runs, or
(for a regular class trigger) that the named class is on the classpath, it will activate the associated hints,
informing the native-image build process what is needed.

It is best practice to use the hints in a sample (existing or new one) in order to have automated testing of it. Once
you are happy with the hints you crafted, you can
https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-native/pulls[submit a pull request].

Using the <<tracing-agent>> can also be useful an approximation of the required native configuration without having
to run too much native builds.

=== Dynamic native configuration

==== Implementing `NativeConfiguration`

Sometimes the necessary configuration is hard to statically declare and needs a more dynamic approach.
For example, the interfaces involved in a proxy hint might need something to be checked beyond the simple
presence of a class. In this case the method `computeHints` can be implemented which allows computation of hints
in a more dynamic way, which are then combined with those statically declared via annotations.

The `NativeConfiguration` interface contains a couple of default methods that can be implemented for more control.
For example whether the hints on a `NativeConfiguration` should activate may be a more subtle condition that simply
whether a configuration is active. It is possible to implement the `isValid` method in a `NativeConfiguration`
implementation and perform a more detailed test, returning false from this method will deactivate the associated hints.

==== Taking more control via processors

Within a Spring application there are going to be a number of active components (the main application, configurations,
controllers, etc). There may be much more sophisticated analysis to be done for these components in order to compute
the necessary configuration for the `native-image` invocation.
It is possible to implement a couple of interfaces to participate in the process the feature is going through:

* `ComponentProcessor` implementations are given the chance to process components and possibly register new configuration. For example this is used by spring-data (via `SpringDataComponentProcessor`) to do deeper analysis of repositories and the types used in generic signatures to compute reflection/proxy/resource hints.
* `SpringFactoriesProcessor` implementations are given a chance to process the keys and values loaded from `spring.factories` files. Currently they are allowed to do filtering but this is likely to be expanded in the future. By filtering it means they may programmatically compute that for some spring.factories key one of the values makes no sense (by analysing classpath contents, for example). In this case they can filter out that value and the `spring.factories` subsequently added to the native-image will have it removed.

These need to be implemented in `spring-aot`. For debugging them using the Maven plugin, you can use `mvnDebug` instead
of `mvn` and connect with a JVM remote debugger from you IDE.

=== Using container-based build environment

In order to allow easily reproducible builds of `spring-native`, dedicated interactive Docker images are available for local development (tested on Linux and Mac) and are also used in the CI:

- https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-native/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile.graalvm-ce[`graalvm-ce`]: base image with Ubuntu bionic + GraalVM native, built daily by the CI and available from https://hub.docker.com/r/springci/graalvm-ce/tags[Docker hub] or locally via `docker/build-graalvm-ce-images.sh`.
- https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-native/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile.spring-native[`spring-native`]: base image with `graalvm-ce` + utilities required to build the project, available from https://hub.docker.com/r/springci/spring-native/tags[Docker hub] or locally via `docker/build-spring-native-images.sh`.
- https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-native/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile.spring-native-dev[`spring-native-dev`]: local image built via `docker/build-dev-images.sh` designed to share the same user between the host and the container

To use it:

- https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[Install Docker].
- https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user[Configure it to allow non-root user] if you are on Linux.
- On Mac, ensure in the Docker preferences resources tab that you give it enough memory, ideally 10G or more, otherwise you may see out of memory issues when building images.
- Run `run-dev-container.sh` to run the Docker container with an interactive shell suitable to run `spring-native` build scripts (see bellow for more documentation).
- The first time, it will download remote based images built by the https://ci.spring.io/teams/spring-native/pipelines/spring-native?group=Daily%20builds[CI].
- The current and the Maven home directories are shared between the host (where is typically the IDE) and the container (where you can run builds).

==== `run-dev-container.sh`

`run-dev-container.sh` runs Spring Native for GraalVM dev container with an interactive shell.

```
run-dev-container.sh [options]

options:
-h, --help                show brief help
-j, --java=VERSION        specify Java version to use, can be 8 or 11, 8 by default
-g, --graalvm=VERSION     specify GraalVM version to use, can be 20.1-dev or master, 20.1-dev by default
-w, --workdir             specify the working directory, should be an absolute path, current one by default
-p, --pull                force pulling of remote container images
-r, --rebuild             force container image rebuild
```

==== Usual dev workflow

- Import the root project in your IDE.
- Eventually import the sample you are working on as a distinct project in your IDE.
- Run `run-dev-container.sh` to run the Docker container with an interactive shell.
- Run the root project `build.sh` (from the host or the container) if you have made modification to the feature, substitutions or configuration modules.
- Run `build.sh` of the sample you are working on from the container.

To test the various samples You can also run the root `build.sh` then `build-key-samples.sh` (test only key samples) or `build-samples.sh` (test all samples) from the container.

=== Scripts

The `native-image` command supports a number of flags for producing information about what is in an image. However, what
can sometimes be really useful is comparing two images. What is in one that isn't in the other? Sometimes sifting through
the ton of output is tricky. The scripts folder provides some tools to help with this.

==== Comparing images

First up is `-H:+PrintAOTCompilation` which prints logging information during compilation, looking a bit like this:

----
Compiling FieldPosition[] java.text.DecimalFormat.getNegativeSuffixFieldPositions()  [Direct call from StringBuffer DecimalFormat.subformat(StringBuffer, Format$FieldDelegate, boolean, boolean, int, int, int, int)]
Compiling FieldPosition[] java.text.DecimalFormat.getPositiveSuffixFieldPositions()  [Direct call from StringBuffer DecimalFormat.subformat(StringBuffer, Format$FieldDelegate, boolean, boolean, int, int, int, int)]
----

Thousands and thousands of lines typically. Typically we turn on that option for `native-image` in the `pom.xml` or in the `compile.sh`
(depending on the sample). The output is produced to stdout which our samples capture in `target/native-image/output.txt`. With two
builds done, we can use a script from this folder to produce a tree diff:

----
compilationDiff.sh java8build/target/native-image/output.txt java11build/target/native-image/output.txt 8-11.html
----

The inputs are the two collected PrintAOTCompilation outputs to compare and the name for an HTML
file that should be generated (this will contain the navigable tree). Then simply open the HTML file.

One of the key entries to look at in the diff is under the path `com/oracle/svm/reflect` as that shows
the entries included due to reflection.
