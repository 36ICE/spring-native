## Kafka "Hello, world!" App

This is working now but there is no docker compose for running Kafka yet, needs adding.

This sample is also being driven by configuration collected from running with the agent, we need to address that.

Mac starting kafka: zookeeper-server-start /usr/local/etc/kafka/zookeeper.properties & kafka-server-start /usr/local/etc/kafka/server.properties
